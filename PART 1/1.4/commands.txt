* i'm on a windows 11 machine, the commands i used are the following:

docker run --rm -it ubuntu bash -c "while true; do echo 'Input website:'; read website; echo 'Searching..'; sleep 1; curl http://$website; done"

* curl command was not found, so i created a terminal session on the container and installed curl package:

docker exec -it 14b86e bash

apt-get update && apt-get install curl

* the program was still not working i was getting the following error:

curl: (3) URL using bad/illegal format or missing URL

* the problem was powershell recognized $website as a variable, so i had to skip it using the following syntax:

docker run --rm -it ubuntu bash -c "while true; do echo 'Input website:'; read website; echo 'Searching..'; sleep 1; curl http://`$website; done"

* program finally worked out, showing the following output when setting helsinki.fi as an input:

Input website:
helsinki.fi
Searching..
